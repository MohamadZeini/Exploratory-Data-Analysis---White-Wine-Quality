# Exploratory-Data-Analysis---White-Wine-Quality
In this project, we explore and analyze a dataset related to white variants of the Portuguese “Vinho Verde” wine. There are many factors that affect the taste and quality of wine such as: alcohol content, acidity and pH level, sugar content, chlorides and etc.  In this dataset, the inputs (physicochemical properties) include objective tests (e.g. pH values) and the output (quality of wine) is based on sensory data (median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts). Each expert graded the wine quality between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent). We will investigate the relationships between different physicochemical properties of wine and quality of wine.
